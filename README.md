The "Starknet Beacon" project is an imaginative venture that enables enthusiasts to construct an animated Starknet logo sign using 3D printing technology.
This initiative is designed to be accessible to hobbyists at any skill level, highlighting the community's inclusivity in the creative process.
It's freely shared under the GPL 3.0 license, granting the freedom to use, adapt, and share.
For assembly, participants will require access to 3D printing facilities to utilize the supplied STL files, along with basic electronics (LEDs, a motor) and assembly components.
This project not only demonstrates inventive engineering but also encourages the community to engage with both technology and creativity in a new and meaningful way.
